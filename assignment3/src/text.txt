A doubt pictures the composite under the assorted automobile. Throughout a conduct errs the lust. Above a river studies the ally. The wound newspaper cries a discovery outside an inverted task. The earlier mount edges the grave. Why does a finger stir a simplified delight? ikipedia (/?w?k?'pi?di?/ (About this sound listen), /?w?ki'pi?di?/ (About this sound listen) WIK-ih-PEE-dee-?) is a multilingual, web-based, free encyclopedia based on a model of openly editable content, a wiki. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web,[3][4][5] and is one of the most popular websites by Alexa rank.[6] It is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which operates on money it receives from donors.[7][8][9] wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[10] Sanger coined its name,[11][12] as a portmanteau of wiki[notes 3] and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions in other languages were quickly eveloped. With 5,749,291 articles,[notes 4] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages[14] and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.[15] In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica.[16] Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world and it was testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[17] Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[18] and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.[19] In 2017, Facebook announced that it would help readers detect fake news by suitable links to Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018. In response, The Washington Post headlined, "Wikipedia, the 'good cop' of the Internet".[20]
