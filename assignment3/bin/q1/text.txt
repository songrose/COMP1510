Wikipedia (/?w?k?'pi?di?/ (About this sound listen), /?w?ki'pi?di?/ (About this sound listen) WIK-ih-PEE-dee-?) is a multilingual, web-based, free encyclopedia based on a model of openly editable content, a wiki. It is the largest and most popular general reference work on the World Wide Web,[3][4][5] and is one of the most popular websites by Alexa rank.[6] It is owned and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation, a non-profit organization which operates on money it receives from donors.[7][8][9]

Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[10] Sanger coined its name,[11][12] as a portmanteau of wiki[notes 3] and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions in other languages were quickly developed. With 5,749,260 articles,[notes 4] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages[14] and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.[15]

In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica.[16] Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world and it was testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[17]

Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[18] and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.[19] In 2017, Facebook announced that it would help readers detect fake news by suitable links to Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018. In response, The Washington Post headlined, "Wikipedia, the 'good cop' of the Internet"


Like any other social media site Facebook has length requirements when it comes to writing on the wall, providing status, messaging and commenting. Understanding how many characters you can use, enables you to more effectively use Facebook as a business or campaign tool.

Private messaging is one of the main ways that people interact on Facebook. This type of direct messaging can be either an instant message (chat), or a regular email-type message. For both instant and regular messaging, there is a 20,000 character limit. 

A Facebook status may have character limits, but considering that it is at 63,206 characters, unless you are writing War and Peace, you should be fine. Facebook has raised this number 12 times to accommodate user’s status and feedback.

Facebook wall posts have a 5000 character limit, but truncation begins at 477 characters. This enables someone to write a thoughtful response or create something similar to a blog.

An area which is rarely used in Facebook is the Notes section. It is a writing area which many bloggers find useful. The reason is because Facebook Notes does not have a character limit, as of yet. Users are directed to this area if they have very long status or comment to make. This can be used to someone's advantage if they have a longer post to make and wish to share it with their friends through tagging.

At Facebook, users upload and post new photos every day. When uploading pictures, users may need to write a description, which has a 5000 character limit. Once uploaded, few friends will comment about the post, which should give them a character limit of 8000 characters.

On news feeds, long posts only show the first 1,200 or so characters.
